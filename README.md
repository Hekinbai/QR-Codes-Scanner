# QR-Codes-Scanner

This app uses ZXingScanner Library to help people scan QR codes. 
If you are running Android 6.0+ then go to settings, find your app and enable camera permission to make it work.
I am working on a feature that checks if you have this permission enabled or not.
It will be more convenient to turn permissions on in the app :)

Our group has some big plans for this app, stay tuned!
